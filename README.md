# Course Material :books:
- **Day 1:** Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering - Explore the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning, inference acceleration, and reasoning models. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.
- **Day 2:** Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.
- **Day 3:** Generative AI Agents - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process, including recent agentspace development.
- **Day 4:** Domain-Specific LLMs - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.
- **Day 5:** MLOps for Generative AI - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.
